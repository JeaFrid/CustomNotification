# Custom Notification

## What is this?

Custom Notification scheme provides a fully customizable notification experience. It provides customized buttons, customized title, subtitle and link. Also the whole design can be recolored.

## How to use?

* Add all the extensions in the **‚ÄúRequired Extension‚Äù** folder to your project.
* Download the file named **CustomNotificationBlocks.png** to your computer and then drag and drop it between your blocks.
* Import the failing components from the component palette into your project.
* Download the file named **ClickButtonsBlocks.png** to your computer and then drag and drop it between your blocks.
* Import the failing components from the component palette into your project.

**An example usage;**

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/bybug.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blocks6.png?w=675&ssl=1" width="200" height="200" />

In the image you see above, we simply created the schematic.

The component named "TopContainer" acts as 'Create layout' for 'Relative View'.

'Container' indicates where the schema will be created.

**Clickable example;**

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/bybug.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blocks7.png?resize=1024%2C292&ssl=1" width="200" height="200" />

The block you see above controls the click event. Separate control is provided for each button. You can add your work blocks there.

**Let's test it;**
